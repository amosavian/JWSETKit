## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a known or suspected vulnerability in JWSETKit, 
[use this section to report a vulnerability.](https://github.com/amosavian/JWSETKit/security/advisories/new)

Fixes to JWSETKit will be released simultaneously with any changes that need to be made in JWSETKit,
to avoid the risk of having only partially fixed projects.
